class StateT2Dependency(UnitModel[T], Generic[T]):
	"""
	Used to specify how "tied state t2" units should select the associated required t2 document.

	T2Processor needs to retrieve the T2Records of units tied with this unit.
	If link_override is unspecified, t2 dependencies are resolved - for each StateT2Dependency -
	using the db match query: {unit: <unit_name>, link: <same link as root doc>}.

	This behavior is overridable/customizable via 't2_dependency->link_override' (t2 config dict).
	'link_override' allows to link a state T2 with a different value than the one registered as 'link' in the T2Record.

	For example, link_override enables to tie a state T2 with the result of a point t2
	(the returned link could be the id of the first datapoint contained in the compound)
	"""

	#: - None: the state associated with the root tied state T2 will be used (value of 'link' in t2 doc)
	#: - DPSelection: allows tied state T2 units to be bound with point t2 units.
	link_override: None | DPSelection
